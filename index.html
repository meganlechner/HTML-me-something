            <p>My first dog as an adult (Budward, may he rest in peace) absolutely ruined me.<br>
            <br>
            He was <em>perfect</em>. Lots of people who met him might disagree - might say he was "fine," for example,
            or, "mostly a pretty good dog." They are all wrong: he was flawless. He rarely barked, never whined, 
            had very minimal interest in other dogs, or, for that matter, people. He protected me tirelessly,
            from friends and enemies alike, and was a constant presence in whatever room I was in without ever being
            under my feet. Training him was a breeze: he just listend to what I wanted him to do, and for the most
            part, did it.<br>
            <br>
            This gave me a very false impression of pet ownership. <br>
            <br>
            I grew up with pets - always a dog, occasionally two, against a backdrop of one cat who mostly 
            kept to himself - but they were always, at their hearts, my mom's pets. They were varying degrees of
            devoted to her; I was a nice enough human who could open the treat jar, sure, but if I disappeared
            to go to college or join the circus, it was a mild disappointment at worst. Budward, on the other
            hand, hung on my every word and glance. He went everywhere with me and was always well-behaved. (Okay,
            sometimes he nipped people for being too loud and too close. He was a shepherd. Also, he wasn't wrong.)
            <br>
            <br>
            So obviously, I have a great relationship with this dog, I read the articles and see the Sarah McLachlan
            commercials - why wouldn't I adopt another pet? I can save lives! <br>
            <br>
            This is the story of how things went downhill from there.

                    <p> A couple months before I graduated from college, a friend found a "kitten" (her words) on campus.
                        This friend
                        lived in a dorm and thus couldn't keep a kitten for even a short amount of time; not wanting to 
                        send a tiny little all black kitten to a shelter a week before Halloween, I said I would take her
                        in. <br>
                        <br>
                        This cat, y'all.<br>
                        <br>
                        First of all, she was not a "kitten" in the way you think of a kitten. She was a full height cat
                        - within a few weeks of moving in, she was also a full length cat. Second of all, she has one meow.
                        Total. One tone. And it is <b>accusatory</b>. And! She's a "talker"! Great! Remember when I said
                        I loved Budward because he was <em>basically silent?</em> Not Chloe! YEARS later, a friend heard
                        her complaining and asked, "Oh, is she part Siamese?" I immediately responsed, "IS THAT WHAT'S
                        WRONG WITH HER??"<br>
                        <br>
                        She is now 13 years old and has mellowed considerably - most of her complaints are valid now,
                        and she is still a very sweet and friendly cat. Or maybe I have just developed a new appreciation
                        for her, for reasons that will become apparent later.

                    <p>Once I bought a house and finally had a fenced in yard, I could finally get another dog. I was
                        volunteering at a shelter at the time, which is how I met Skillet.<br>
                        <br>
                        Skillet was (and still is, despite this serious photo) the happiest dog you have ever met. Even 
                        when he lived in a 5' x 8'cinderblock room, he would lay at the front of his "apartment" with his 
                        front paws crossed and his tail would go CRAZY if you so much as looked at him. He is the more 
                        generally accepted definition of the perfect dog. He enjoys roasting in the sun and spending his evenings
                        on the front porch without a leash because <em>he's that good.</em><br>

                        <caption>His rescuer called him a "wolf puppy" because he was a wild animal.</caption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>As Budward got on in years and his health deteriorated, we started looking at possibly getting
                        another dog to, essentially, keep Skillet company. Which is how we ended up with Remus.<br>
                        <br>
                        Remus came from a rescue called The Feral Companion, which specializes in saving shy and special 
                        needs dogs that other shelters would put down. Remus was very much the former - he was found,
                        along with his mom and brother, on some rural property outside of Atlanta, GA, and the two "puppies" 
                        - about 8 months old at the time - had never seen humans before. After six months in a local rescue,
                        still no one could touch them, so TFC agreed to take them in and they were transferred to Saint
                        Louis. They were so terrified of people, the woman who runs the rescue had to pet them with a golf
                        club through the bars of their crates because otherwise they would bite her in fear.<br>
                        <br>
                        We didn't know that, though. After months of working with Remus, she brought him to our house for 
                        a meet-and-greet, where he picked up and relocated every dog toy he came across, actively avoided us,
                        and tried to hide
                        behind her in a one-person chair (he's 65 lbs). Because we're totally normal people, we saw all 
                        this and said, "WE LOVE HIM! Leave him here!" We could hardly touch him for a week; he wore a leash 24/7 
                        for most of a month because it was the only way we could catch him.<br>
                        <br>
                        Obviously...he got better. Most people just think he is shy and easily startled now; they don't 
                        realize he used to be an actual wild animal who lived alone in the woods.<br>
                        <br>
                        He is also the actual softest dog that there has ever been.

                    <p>In 2018, Budward succumbed to a degenerative spinal condition (and advanced age) in May.
                        After several months of living with Skillet and Remus as my only dogs, I was feeling like
                        something was missing. They were both, by this point, Very Good Boys, but I was feeling Budward's 
                        absence - he would always come see what I was doing, ask me to do something else (usually scratch
                        his ears), and just generally make himself a presence at all times. Skillet and Remus both 
                        chilled on the couch unless I suggested going for a walk. I started browsing Petfinder. <br>
                        <br>
                        That's how I found a herding breed rescue based in Kansas City. In October I reached out to them
                        about a dog on their website; they responded to say he was troubled and they wanted him placed
                        locally in case there were issues, but they had a similar dog who just came in, would I be 
                        interested in him instead? <br>
                        <br>
                        Do I seem like someone who's picky about dogs?<br>
                        <br>
                        So we drove out to KC to meet this dog. For reference, the dog I initially inquired about was
                        a standard Australian shepherd, which are generally around 50 lbs; the "similar" dog, when we 
                        saw him in person, was a miniature Aussie, about 15 lbs, and either damaged or inbred to the point of 
                        running in circles and doing very little else. He was also a skilled escape artist (aided, no doubt,
                        by his ABSURDLY small size), slipping out the door and into the lobby literally every time it opened.<br>
                        <br>
                        Uh, pass.<br>
                        <br>
                        But! They were not to be deterred! They had two other recent arrivals in the car who were returning from a 
                        meet-and-greet with another family, would we like to meet them? The other family was deciding
                        between them, so one of the two was technically unavailable, but they didn't know which one yet.
                        So we met the two of them; I liked one, my husband liked the other, so we said we would take 
                        whichever one the family <em>didn't</em> choose.<br>
                        <br>
                        Y'all, this is the last time I'm letting my husband pick out our dog.<br>
                        <br>
                        The family chose the one I liked, of course, so we loaded the other dog in the car and drove the four
                        hours home, where he slept on my lap literally the entire drive. How sweet! How promising! HOW
                        MISLEADING.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first 48 hours, he was a terror in our home. Constantly bothering his new brothers, picking 
                        fights, and chasing the cat. He did okay when he was alone - I took him to meet my mom and he did
                        great - but when we were at home I was constantly questioning if we should take him back to the 
                        shelter. And then, on the third day, he and Remus started PLAYING. Like, full on, chasing each other 
                        at top speed in our tiny backyard, run-and-tackle, wrestle-to-the-ground, <em>mutual</em> playing.
                        So he got to stay. <br>
                        <br>
                        And here my troubles began.<br>
                        <br>
                        Once Wilbur figured out that he was home, the things that made him slightly nervous were now
                        things he needed to protect us from. All of a sudden, we couldn't take him 
                        anywhere. He barked, growled, and lunged at strangers; he attacked strange dogs; he flipped out at
                        provocations so slight we could hardly walk him. We worked with a trainer who helped us get his 
                        threshold up, so we could at least take him places where other people were <em>visible</em> and he 
                        wouldn't freak out unless they came close to us, but then he plateaued and the trainer didn't have 
                        any other solutions. More recently, we finally found a different trainer who had other strategies, 
                        and Wilbur is, at last, making some progress - I can walk him again, and we are making progress meeting 
                        strangers - although they still can't make eye contact or he loses his mind.<br>
                        <br>
                        All that being said, if you had surveillance footage of us going about our day at home, you would 
                        think Wilbur was our <em>best</em> dog. He is obedient, snuggly, sweet, wants to be near us all 
                        the time, and hardly ever chases the cat anymore. For this...we let him ruin our lives.

                    <p>A couple of months ago, we sold our old house in favor of a bigger house with a bigger yard. A month 
                        or so before <em>that</em>, we were at the old house painting when we heard a <em>very</em> pathetic 
                        little kitten mew from the neighbor's shrubs. Obviously, I called, "Kitty-kitty-kitty?" and a 
                        grown ass cat came out of the bushes, mewing like a lost little kitten. I scratched its head and 
                        turned to go back inside, assuming it would return to my neighbor's porch (Where the Cat Food 
                        Comes From), but instead it sidled in alongside me and explored the house - which had already 
                        been emptied of most of its furniture, so I let him go for a few minutes, assuming he'd lose
                        interest.<br>
                        <br>
                        Not so much. After about ten minutes he came out and made himself comfortable on the remaining 
                        couch.<br>
                        <br>
                        After I finished painting the room I was working on, I put him back outside. He looked clean, 
                        healthy, and not-starving, so I figured he had a home and would go back to it. Yeah, no. He sat 
                        outside the door and screamed, "HELLO! HELLO?? HELLO!" Realizing he might be 
                        legitimately lost, I let him back in and made some posts on the internet looking for his real mom. 
                        I took him to PetSmart, but he wasn't chipped. The only responses to my 'found cat' post were 
                        neighbors saying, "Haha! That's your cat now!"<br>
                        <br>
                        I couldn't leave him at the house forever (see: we were selling it), so eventually I brought him 
                        home and introduced him to everyone else. Chloe had put the fear of god in the dogs already, so all 
                        three dogs were basically terrified of him. Chloe hated his guts. He LOVED Chloe - following her 
                        around, imitating everything she did, and basically staying juuuuust out of reach of her 
                        swats (mostly). <br>

                        As Frank settled in (I couldn't just call him kitty-kitty forever), he got more annoying by the day. 
                        First he started calling for us to liberate him from the basement. "HELLO! HELLO??" Then he 
                        started making it known that he couldn't survive on the pittance we were feeding him - he started 
                        sneaking around eating literally ALL of Chloe's food, then, when we locked him away from it, 
                        starting screaming and rattling the door to the room it was in. Then he started fishing in the 
                        drain of the kitchen sink, trying to pull up stray beans and tiny scraps of lettuce because, you 
                        know, he was just <em><b>starving</b></em>. (He's not, by the way. He's been to the vet; there's 
                        nothing wrong with him, he just desperately
                        wants to be fat.) But he gets his claw stuck in the sink strainer and throws it on the floor at 
                        least twice a day now. If he wants to play, he goes to the entryway and meows as loud as he can - 
                        but if you go find him, he stalks away from you in disgust, I think because he actually wants to 
                        play with another cat, and as previously mentioned, Chloe hates him.<br>
                        <br>
                        So like...let me know if you know anyone who needs a cat...?</p>
